Fever & Headache 2025/4/25

I felt incredibly strange when I first woke up this morning â€“ almost like a disoriented octopus. I soon realized I had a fever, and things felt much worse when I woke up again later.
Washing my face and drinking water didn't help much; I still felt glued to my bed. I hadn't anticipated how debilitating a fever could be.

OK, let's have some pills. My heat started to decrease, and I finally my consciousness 2 hours later.

One thing happened: I could feel my body and limbs, and be reminiscent when thinking. Strange Feeling. I guess it is some effects of the disease? I don't know, when my fever gone, will this remain?
