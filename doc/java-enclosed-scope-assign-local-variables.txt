When you want to assign a free variable in a closure, you will normally see:

Local variable found defined in an enclosing scope must be final or effectively final

either mark it final, or wrap it in an array as a workaround:

    int[] result = new int[1];
    hibernateSession.doWork(new Work() {
        @Override
        public void execute(Connection conn) throws SQLException {
            result[0] = 1;
        }
    });
