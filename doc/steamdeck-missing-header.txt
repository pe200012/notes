For disk space efficiency reasons, Valve did a clean-up of several Arch packages. They marked as installed, but miss a several files.

A lot of compilation problems are fixed by reinstalling glibc and linux-api-headers:

pacman -S glibc linux-api-headers

Source of the idea: Compiling C++ code

UPDATE: Another useful command which restores all packages to the original state:

pacman -Qknq | cut -d' ' -f1 | sort -u | pacman -S -

It consists of several steps: pacman -Qknq produces a list of packages with missing files, cut and sort -u make it short, and pacman -S - re-installs those packages. Take note that by default there's not much free space on the root partition, so expansion via OverlayFS is recommended (rwfus can be used, or a custom mount entry/script).
